# STM32EthernetTest
Scratch work testing STM32 integration with a freertos TCP/IP stack, mongoose for HTTP/Websockets, and ENC28J60 for MAC

This is horribly organized, specific to a pile of hardware I happen to have on my desk right now, and is only to test various concepts that keep coming into my brain. 

It is fit for no particular purpose.

# TODO List

1) NT4 client implementation in C
2) Settings - web + backend
3) Settings - EEPROM support
4) ~~Complementary filter on all axes~~
5) ~~Rolling calibration~~
6) Periodic save cal to EEPROM
