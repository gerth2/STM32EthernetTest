# STM32EthernetTest
Scratch work testing STM32 integration with a freertos TCP/IP stack, minnowserver for HTTP/Websockets, and ENC28J60 for MAC

This is horribly organized, specific to a pile of hardware I happen to have on my desk right now, and is only to test various concepts that keep coming into my brain. 

It is fit for no particular purpose.
